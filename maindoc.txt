[REDACTED SPECIES] ([REDACTED SPECIES]) is a widely distributed perennial angiosperm found in many areas of [REDACTED LOCATION] and [REDACTED LOCATION]. This study investigated the ability of underground storage structures and rhizomes with different numbers of nodes to regenerate successfully from three monitored field sites. Two of the sites had been subject to herbicide treatment for two years prior to sampling and the third site had no history of herbicide treatment. No significant differences were observed in regenerated stem diameter, maximum height of stem and maximum growth increments among underground storage structures. All traits measured from the planted underground storage structures were significantly greater than those of the planted rhizome fragments and at least one node was necessary for successful regeneration of rhizomes. The smallest initial fragment weight to regenerate and survive the experiment was 0.5 g. Subjecting all plant material to desiccation for 38 days resulted in no emergence or regeneration after replanting.

Introduction
[REDACTED SPECIES] is a perennial angiosperm. It has large leaves, underground storage structures and produces upright stems (Fig. 1). Regeneration from vegetative material has been documented in prior studies (Child & Wade, 2000). [REDACTED SPECIES] is frequently recorded in managed and disturbed settings, and changes in surrounding vegetation have been documented in some cases (Booy, Wade & Roy, 2015; Gerber et al., 2008; Aguilera et al., 2010; Gillies, Clements & Grenz, 2016).

[REDACTED SPECIES] can regenerate through crowns and rhizomes. The rhizome network is relevant because root:shoot ratios can vary with available nutrients (Hirose, 1987). Rhizome form and growth direction can vary across conditions (Smith et al., 2007). Prior work has reported regeneration from small rhizome fragments (Brock & Wade, 1992; Beerling, Bailey & Conolly, 1994; Francis, Riley & Hoggart, 2008), though the minimum fragment size for reliable regeneration remains uncertain. Other work has demonstrated a dependence of regeneration on rhizome length (Sásik & Pavol Jr, 2006), and Francis, Riley & Hoggart (2008) suggested that, for regeneration from stems, node number may be an important determinant. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to make conclusive statements on the most relevant metric (rhizome weight, length or number of nodes) required for successful regeneration.

Stems, as well as rhizomes, are plant organs of [REDACTED SPECIES] that contribute to seasonal persistence (Brock et al., 1995). With new stands growing each year and dead stems remaining upright over winter (Fig. 1) due to slow decay rates (Vrchotová et al., 2005), stem density (from both dead and alive stems) can be substantial (Callaghan, Scott & Whittaker, 1981), reflecting efficient use of space, sunlight and resources by [REDACTED SPECIES] (Townsend, 1997). Although this will vary due to environmental conditions and crown size, the combination of underground and aboveground biomass characteristics appears to support consistent growth relative to nearby shrubs and woody perennials.

Although many plants are drought tolerant, far fewer are known to be fully desiccation tolerant. Drought tolerance usually means that plants are able to dry out to around 23% of their fresh weight with no bulk water present in their cytoplasm but desiccation tolerance refers to even further dehydration that —once rehydrated —does not damage the plant cells (Hoekstra, Golovina & Buitink, 2001). This anhydrobiosis is often an adaptation to severe environmental conditions. For example, the desert plant Selaginella lepidophylla commonly called the “resurrection plant” is known to be able to survive almost total desiccation. Although many mosses are desiccation tolerant, far fewer angiosperms and no gymnosperms are known to be able to survive desiccation (Alpert, 2005). Drying angiosperms to equilibrium with air (dry weight) kills virtually all of them (Alpert, 2006). Desiccation studies on aquatic plant species have highlighted that some species can survive even significant drying (Coughlan et al., 2018), while terrestrial plants have been shown to be more susceptible to desiccation (e.g., Rumex species; Alshallash & Hatcher, 2020). However, no experiments focusing on how [REDACTED SPECIES] responds to a period of air drying and replanting were identified in the literature.

This study assesses the following: (1) the regeneration of different sizes of [REDACTED SPECIES] fragment both exposed and unexposed to herbicide treatment; (2) the effects of nodes on rhizome fragment regeneration; and (3) the effect of desiccation by air drying on rhizome fragment regeneration.

Methods
Fieldwork
Three sites in northern [REDACTED LOCATION] (Fig. 2), two with two years of herbicide treatment and one with no recorded treatment history, were sampled in early April 2019 near the start of the growing season, which avoided concerns about winter dormancy impacting results. Both treated sites were associated with managed waterside corridors and had similar treatment histories (two years of glyphosate-based herbicide treatment applied in October 2017 and 2018). The untreated site had comparable general conditions with slightly sandier soil. Collection of plant material was undertaken between 1st and 4th April 2019. Ten crowns and three sections of rhizome per crown were excavated from each site using spade, trowel and hand (to gently remove the ends of the more delicate rhizomes). Crowns were selected randomly once they had at least one live cane emerging (current year's growth) and one dead cane (showing that the rhizome had produced above-ground material in a previous year). Rhizomes were separated from the crowns at the point where they emerge from the crown. Once excavated, crowns and rhizomes were sealed in plastic bags and transported to the lab. Permission to sample was obtained in advance from relevant site managers.

Laboratory work
Once in the lab, crowns were fresh weighted and potted. Crowns varied in size as described in Supplemental Information. Plant fragments were potted in pots of an appropriate size based on fragment size. Rhizome fragments were potted in square sided pots of nine cm per side and crowns were potted in either medium-sized pots of 21 cm diameter or large-sized pots for crowns over 900 g fresh weight (five per site; Supplemental Information) of 30 cm diameter). Crowns were potted at surface level and rhizomes were covered with soil to a depth of approximately one cm. Plants were potted the day after collection and drying was prevented by storage overnight in a cold room. Since the composition of soil biota is a potential variable that could affect [REDACTED SPECIES] growth (Parepa, Schaffner & Bossdorf, 2013), the soil mixture was standardised throughout the experiments, consisting of multi-purpose compost (John Innes Multi-Purpose compost) mixed with garden soil at a ratio of 1:4. The garden soil was sampled from an area in Wakefield, [REDACTED LOCATION], that is known to not contain [REDACTED SPECIES] and is a silty clay loam, similar to the sites where the samples were collected.

For the rhizome investigation, three segments of rhizome from each crown were collected, yielding a total of 30 segments from each site. One fragment with two nodes, one fragment with one node and one fragment with no nodes were sub-sampled from each rhizome segment resulting in three subsamples of each node classification from each crown, to reduce the possibility of one unhealthy rhizome distorting results. This resulted in the potting of 30 full crowns and 270 rhizome fragments in total.

All crowns and rhizomes were watered twice a week and the amount of water was normalised to the size of the pot (so that all samples received the same relative amount of water). Fertiliser (Baby Bio Original Plant Feed: standard NPK fertiliser with Nitrogen (10.6%); Phosphorus (1.9%), Potassium (1.4%) and organic matter) was added to the watering regime (10 ml per litre) on day 1, day 30 and day 50 of the 60-day experimental period to ensure the availability of nutrients throughout the experiment. Pots were randomly organised and placed on a laboratory bench by the window so that they were exposed to sunlight. They were subject to room temperature (with nightly minima above approximately 9 °C and daily maxima between 15–36 °C, with average daily temperature ranges of approximately 19–25 °C).

Both emergence (new growth) and regeneration were monitored throughout the experiment. Emergence was considered to have occurred when a new bud or stem was observed growing from the crown or rhizome fragment. Successful regeneration was considered to have occurred when a new bud emerged, burst and formed one leaf. Stem height was measured by recording the height from the surface of the soil to the tip of the stem. If stems did not show the traits mentioned, they were classed as an emergence but not regeneration.

Once the growth phase of the experiment ended (after 60 days), all underground biomass was left on plastic sheets to dry in the lab, which was generally between 19 and 25 °C during the day and around 9 °C minimum at night. Plant fragments were weighed at least once per week and this drying process continued until 10% or less of mass was lost between measurements and lasted for 38 days (by which time all plant fragments met these criteria including even the largest crowns (see Supplemental Information). The dried biomass was replanted under the same conditions as the first pot experiment and observed for an additional 60 day period. Treatment of the planted dry biomass replicated the initial 60 day growth experiment with fertiliser (Baby Bio) applied on day 1, 30 and 50 and water applied twice per week.

All field and laboratory work and the disposal of material at the end of the experiment followed strict handling protocols in line with the [REDACTED LOCATION] health and safety standards.

Statistical analysis
Anderson-Darling normality tests were completed prior to any test for differences in regeneration and growth rates between six categories (ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis testing). Subsequent post hoc tests included Fisher’s pairwise comparison, Mann–Whitney U test or T-test depending on their distributions. A range of statistical software packages were used to obtain the results including R, Minitab (version 18) and GPower (Faul et al., 2009; GPower 3.1.9.4). ImageJ (2019, v1.51c: documentation and downloads at website http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/, [REDACTED LOCATION]) was used to measure leaf area. All raw data are provided in the Supplemental Information.

Results
Emergence and regeneration
The experiment ran for 60 days with 88.5% (293/331 stems) of stems emerging within the first 30 days (Fig. 3) and an additional 10 emerging during the final four days of the experiment. A total of 38 stems (11.48% of all regenerations) emerged between day 31 and day 60 (Fig. 3; Table 1), highlighting that 30 days in not long enough to track emergence (or regeneration) of [REDACTED SPECIES]. All three sites had emergences during this period from both crowns and rhizomes.

Day 16 had the most new emergences with 57 new buds emerging above the surface of the soil. Figure 3 shows that emergences from rhizomes experience a longer lag time compared to full crowns with the first crown emergences occurring on day 3 and the first rhizome emergences occurring on day 7.

Successful regeneration occurred in both crowns and rhizomes with one or two nodes. No emergence (or regeneration) was recorded from any rhizome fragment with zero nodes, regardless of fragment weight or length. Table 1 shows that full crowns exhibited the highest success rate with the only failed regenerations occurring in [REDACTED LOCATION] (20% (two crowns) failed to regenerate) and that with the increasing size categories (zero to one to two nodes to full crowns) there was an increase in successful regeneration.

Growth
Most of the substantial increase in height was observed in the first three weeks, with maximum growth usually occurring in weeks 2–4 (Fig. 4), for all plant fragment types but maximum growth was recorded for two [REDACTED LOCATION] one-node fragments and two [REDACTED LOCATION] crowns in week 5 and for one [REDACTED LOCATION] one-node fragment in week 6 (Supplemental Information). Thereafter, growth decreased or ceased towards the latter half of the study period. The highest weekly growth increment was 111.8 cm per week (Supplemental Information), by a [REDACTED LOCATION] full crown in its second week of growth. The minimum growth rate recorded was 0 cm for at least one plant fragment of each type .There was no significant difference between crowns (Kruskal-Wallis: p = 0.262, H = 2.68; Figs. 4B(i) and Figs. 4C(i)) or one node fragments (p = 0.206, F = 1.7; Figs. 4B(iii) and 4C(iii)) across
